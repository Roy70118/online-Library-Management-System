Online library management system using  object oriented programming in python

I have to create a library class that includes the following mthods:

    Displaybook() : To display the available books
    Lendbook(): To lend a book to a user
    Addbook(): To add a book to the library
    Returnbook(): To return the book to the library.
    
    As I have created a library class, then I will create an object and pass the following parameters in the constructor.

HarryLibrary=Library(listofbooks, library_name)

After that, create a main function and run an infinite while loop that asks the users for their input whether they want to display, lend, add or return a book.

Optional:-

Maintain a dictionary for the users who own a book. Dictionary should take book name as a key and name of the person as a value. Whenever you lend a book to a user, you should maintain a dictionary.
